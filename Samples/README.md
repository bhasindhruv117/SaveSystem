# Save System Samples

This folder contains example implementations showing how to use the Save System package in your Unity games.

## GenericSaveSystemExample

This example demonstrates how to:

1. Initialize the save system
2. Create custom save modules
3. Integrate with game-specific logic
4. Handle saving and loading data
5. Manage dependencies between modules

The example includes three sample modules:
- **PlayerStatsModule**: Stores player health, score, and other stats
- **GameProgressModule**: Tracks level progression and completion
- **SettingsModule**: Manages game settings like audio volumes and display options

To use this example, attach the `GenericSaveSystemExample` component to a GameObject in your scene.
